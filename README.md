### Description

1. Vertical profiles: User will provide two 1-dimensional arrays to the interface, one temperature and one depth.

...Combine to create a table, example below:

Temperature = x | Depth = y
--- | --- 
blah blah blah | whatevs whatevs whatevs 


2. Pick a pattern from that user-given profile with the "correct" numbers and dimensions. 
..* Provide a template CTD cast. 

3. "Match" the two. Take areas under the curve? Image hashing? Gruesome bed cutting pipeline.
..* Vertically segment by user-defined parameters.
